Data Set 1 (10 points):
Score += 10

Data Set 2 (10 points):
("road" data): If you're trying to see correlations between two variables, use a scatter  or hexbin plot, not a bar chart.
Score += 9

Data Set 3 (10 points):
("birthdeathrates" data): Both of your line plots have a categorical as the x-axis. Never plot lines against a categorical, because it implies ordering or progression. You want bar charts here, but you could also look at histograms.
Score += 5

Data Set 4 (10 points):
("heart" data): neither of these plots are helpful or make sense. The line plot uses the index as the x-axis, which has nothing to do with the data. You're looking for a histogram there. The scatter plot should also probably be two histograms. There's a lot of other data that you could have explored here.
Score += 5

Data Set 5 (10 points):
Score += 10

Total score: 39/50 = 78.0%


Comments:
	In general you're a little trigger happy with line plots. Line plots ONLY make sense when there is some sort of ordering or progression (like time).
